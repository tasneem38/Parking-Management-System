# Parking-Management-System

A Vehicle Management System helps organizations improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, extend the life of their fleet, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. In industries like transportation, where large fleets of vehicles need to be tracked and maintained regularly, such systems offer significant value. 

This script is a simple vehicle parking management system designed for 2-wheeler vehicles. It simulates a parking lot with a fixed number of parking slots organized into lanes. Users can interact with the system through a command-line interface to perform tasks like parking a vehicle, listing parked vehicles, searching for specific vehicles, removing vehicles from parking, and checking available slots. The data is stored in a text file (parking_system.txt), making it easy to save and persist the parking lot's state between executions.

The script uses basic Bash commands, such as awk, sed, and echo, to manipulate data and handle input/output operations. The parking slots are represented by a simple comma-separated format that holds the parking slot status (either "Available" or "Parked") alongside vehicle information.

# Components of a Vehicle Management System Using Unix Shell

When developing a Vehicle Management System (VMS) with the Unix shell, several key components come into play:

•	Database Management: The vehicle database can be managed using flat files, CSV files, or more complex database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Shell scripts can be used to query, update, and generate reports from the database.

•	Data Input and Reporting: Shell scripts can be used to gather input from various sources, including text files, logs, or user inputs. Once the data is processed, it can be presented in various formats, such as text reports, CSV, or even HTML, depending on the needs of the organization.

•	Maintenance and Alerts: Regular maintenance schedules can be created using shell scripts that automatically check vehicle status, send reminders for service appointments, and log any repairs made. Automated email notifications or SMS alerts can also be triggered based on specific events, such as the expiration of insurance or overdue maintenance.

•	Log Management: Managing logs is a vital part of any vehicle management system. Unix shell scripts can monitor vehicle-related events and store logs in a structured format. These logs can then be used for troubleshooting, auditing, or regulatory compliance.
